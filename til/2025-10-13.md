# 2025-10-13 RAG stopwords

### Why Remove Stop Words?
Our goal is to match words from the user's input to the words in our dataset. But if we don't remove stop words, we can get some pretty misleading results, here's an example:

*User query*: "the bear"

*Results*:
- "Jungle Bear": matches "bear".
- "The Terminator": matches "the".

Oof! Both documents match, but "Jungle Bear" is clearly more relevant! "the Terminator" only matches on a meaningless stop word.

> Note 
For vanilla RAG with vector embeddings, you're usually fine without explicit stopword removal since the embedding model handles it implicitly through training.
